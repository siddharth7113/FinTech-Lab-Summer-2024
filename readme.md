# FinTech-Lab-Summer-2024

## Project Overview
This project focuses on extracting, analyzing, and visualizing key financial insights from 10-K filings of public firms using a large language model (LLM). The insights are presented through a web interface built with Streamlit, which provides a dynamic way to explore financial trends and data-driven insights.

## Features
- **Data Extraction**: 
    1. Python library SEC-Edgar-Download is used to extract SEC filings.
    2. The filings of any firms can be downloaded using the script located in 
        `src/data/raw_data/download_sec_filings.py`
    3. `Downloader.log`  containes information about the missing as well as the downloaded files.

- **Data Pre-processing**
        
    Pre-processing steps takes in 3 parts :
    1.  First the raw html,css contained is removed from downloaded filings and stored in  `src\data\pre_processed_data\cleaned-sec-edgar-filings`
    2.  Then lemmetization and Stemming is performed on the cleaned data and only 5 words  before and after the numerical feautres  were selected and stored  in
     `src\data\pre_processed_data\processed-numeric-contexts`
    3. Finally using all feautres that are considered finacially insightful(*mentioned below*) are extracted using regex expression and finally stored in  
        `src\data\pre_processed_data\feature`

- **Text Analysis**:
    
    1. Each of these features  files are sent to LLM (**Mixtral-7b-Instruct**) via OpenRouterAPI and saved in `src/output/output-responses`
    2. Using  a python script these annual files for each firm is combined in text format which is stored in `src/output/pre-analysis_combined`.
    3. This combined text is again sent to LLM (**Mixtral-7b-Instruct**) via OpenRouterAPI  to  obtain two types of files :  text_insights, csv_insights.
            (These files are used to  display  content on web server) located  in `src\analysis`
    
- **Data Visualization**: The csv file format obtained from LLM is in txt format due to API limitation , a  simple python script `(src/analysis/csv/txt_to_csv.py)`
                        converts  the files into  csv files


 **Web Interface**: A Streamlit application has been created and deployed. `src\app` contains all the elemnts to  run streamlit  app.

 ### Note

 **For hosting purposes,  a separate  repo has been created for  streamlit but it  contains  the same  files as located in `src/app`.**

### Disclamer

Since the project realibility  heavily depends on LLM inference  model,there is always scope for hallucinations and wrong inferences, thus it is  recommended to  always verify  data
from secondary sources. Note: The project is still under development and currently obtained **graphs and contents** are unreliable.

- Upgrading to a better  model might help with inference.
