 77 Apple Inc. is a publicly-traded company that designs and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and hardware. It is headquartered in Cupertino, California, and was first founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. Since then, Apple has become one of the largest and most successful technology companies in the world, with a market capitalization of over $2.6 trillion as of August 2021.

Apple's financial performance has been strong in recent years, with consistent revenue growth and profits. In the fiscal year ended September 26, 2020, Apple reported total revenue of $ 274.5 billion, an increase of 4.8% from the previous year. Net income was $ 116.8 billion, a significant increase of 177.5% from the previous year. These figures demonstrate the company's strength and continued success in the market.

It is worth noting that Apple's financial performance is highly dependent on its product offerings. The company has a strong portfolio of products, including the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, that have become popular among consumers. Its ability to continuously innovate and release new products that meet consumer needs has helped the company maintain a strong market position.

In terms of financial ratios, Apple's financial position has been strong in recent years. For example, the company's current ratio was 1.58:1 as of September 26, 2020, indicating that it has enough current assets to meet its short-term liabilities. Its debt-to-equity ratio was 0.40:1, which is relatively low and indicates that the company has a strong balance sheet position.

The company's financial performance has also been impacted by its pricing strategy. Apple's products are generally more expensive than those of its competitors, but this has contributed to their strong brand recognition and sales performance. The company has also maintained strict control over expenses and has been able to maintain high profit margins.

Overall, Apple's financial performance has been strong and consistent in recent years, but the company's success is also dependent on its ability to innovate and continue to meet consumer needs. It will be interesting to see how the company performs in the future, particularly as it continues to invest in new products and technologies.
