* Technical issues: companies face challenges in applying both traditional and non-traditional valuation methods due to technical difficulties. (for example, reliable forecasting of future cash flows or revenue streams, calculation of risk-adjusted rates of return or growth projections, uncertainties in valuation inputs such as key assumptions, market duration and incompleteness of information). These technical issues require special technical expertise and knowledge, and may involve aspects like management of expert opinion, defense of the valuation and validity of the data used in it, and communication of the technical aspects of the valuation to non-consultant stakeholders.
