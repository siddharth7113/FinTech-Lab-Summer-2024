This table is purposefully organized to provide a detailed breakdown of costs associated with the construction of all buildings in the company's facilities. It allows stakeholders to assess the likely costs of different projects and make informed decisions about the company's future operations.

In addition to the construction costs, the table also includes non-construction costs associated with each item, such as design fees, permits, and consulting fees. These costs can be an important consideration when planning a new project, as they can significantly impact the overall cost of the project.

Overall, the table in Item 8 of Form 10-K is an essential tool for stakeholders looking to understand the financial implications of different construction projects.
