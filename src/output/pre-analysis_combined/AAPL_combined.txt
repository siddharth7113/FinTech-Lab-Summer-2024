The increase in revenue can be attributed to strong demand for Apple's products, particularly the iPhone and the Mac.

2. Operating Expenses
The total operating expenses for the year ended September 28, 2019, were $ 147.1 billion, which was an increase of 6.3% from the total operating expenses of $ 140.8 billion for the year ended September 29, 2018. The increase in operating expenses can be attributed to higher research and development expenses, as well as higher selling, general and administrative expenses.

3. Net Income
The net income for the year ended September 28, 2019, was $ 48.4 billion, which was a decrease of 11.7% from the net income of $ 60.4 billion for the year ended September 29, 2018. The decrease in net income can be attributed to higher research and development expenses and lower gross profit margin due to higher selling, general, and administrative expenses.

5. Cash Flow
Apple generated cash flow from operating activities for the year ended September 28, 2019, was $ 104.3 billion. The increase in cash flow can be attributed to higher net income and lower capital expenditures.

Conclusion:
Apple's financials indicate that the company is in a strong financial position, with steady revenue growth and a strong balance sheet.

Table A of 2010 Annual Report of Apple Inc.
 This proposal is introducing a new rule that requires corporations to provide entities with a unique identifier. This unique identifier would be used in financial reporting and for regulatory purposes. Currently, companies do not have a way to consistently identify individual entities.

The objective of this rule is to improve the accuracy and transparency of financial reporting by ensuring that entities are correctly identified. This would help regulatory agencies and investors to quickly and easily find the information they need.

The rule would apply to all public companies listed on a stock exchange, as well as certain private companies that meet certain criteria. Exemptions would be provided for entities that are already unique and have a system in place to track and identify their transactions.

The cost of implementing this rule would fall to the companies that are impacted, as they would need to purchase new software or systems to generate and track the new unique identifier. This could add to the cost of compliance for already struggling companies.

The votation on this proposed rule is open to those who are concerned with the accuracy and transparency of financial reporting. If the majority of the votes support the rule, it would be implemented and become mandatory for all affected companies. Otherwise, it would be rejected and no action would be taken.
