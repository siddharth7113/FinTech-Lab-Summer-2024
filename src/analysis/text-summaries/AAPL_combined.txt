 Based on the information provided, it appears that the financial performance of Apple Computer, Inc. has been positive over the past decade. The company has consistently reported strong revenue and net income figures. In 2010, the company reported total revenue of $134.0 billion, which was a significant increase from the previous year. The company's net income also increased in 2010 to $5.9 billion, compared to $4.3 billion in 2009.

The bulk of Apple's revenue for both years came from the sale of Macintosh computers, which accounted for $12.6 billion and $14.5 billion, respectively. However, the revenue generated from the sale of the iPhone in both years was $48.8 billion and $42.1 billion, respectively, which represented significant growth.

The sale of the iPad also contributed to Apple's revenue in both years, with sales reaching $7.4 billion and $9.2 billion, respectively. Additionally, the revenue generated from the sale of software, product, and other income segments was also reported to have increased in 2010.

In terms of selling and marketing expenses, the data shows that since 2010, the company's selling and marketing expenses have increased, indicating that they are spending more money on marketing efforts to promote their products. However, the company's gross margin, which is the difference between the revenue and the cost of goods sold, has also increased from 31% in 2009 to 41.7% in 2010.

On the other hand, the company has experienced some challenges in terms of its profitability, as evidenced by the decrease in net income in 2011 to $17.3 billion, from $59 billion in 2010. This decline can be associated with the lower revenue generated from the sale of Macintosh computers, which dropped to $10.7 billion in 2011 compared to $12.6 billion in 2010.

Furthermore, the decline in the revenue generated from the sale of the iPhone also contributed to the decrease in net income in 2011 to $40.3 billion, compared to $48.8 billion in 2010. However, revenue from the sale of the iPad and the "Other Services" segment continued to grow in 2011.

From 2011 to 2018, the company reported positive net income growth from $17.3 billion in 2011 to $141.7 billion in 2018, and revenue growth from $111.4 billion in 2011 to $210.6 billion in 2018. This growth can be attributed to the sustained popularity of its product offerings, innovative product development, and successful marketing campaigns.

However, in 2019, the company reported a decline in net income to $110.4 billion, while revenue decreased to $259.9 billion. This can be attributed to the slowdown in iPhone sales, and overall lower revenue from all product offerings. Additionally, the increasing selling and marketing expenses also marginally impacted the company's gross margin.

Between 2020 and 2021, the company reported a decline in net income to $ 116.8 billion and revenue to $ 274.5 billion. However, the decline in profitability appeared to be due to the one-time charge related to the acquisition of Intel's manufacturing business.

In conclusion, Apple Computer, Inc. has experienced a relatively positive financial performance over the past decade, driven by strong revenue growth from its Macintosh and iPhone businesses, as well as various other product offerings. However, the company has also faced declines in net income and revenue growth in certain years due to various factors such as declining iPhone sales, an increase in selling expenses, and one-time charges related to acquisitions.
