 Financial Overview:
1.Total revenue:

For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, Google's total revenue was $162,901 million, an increase of 14.2% from $139,053 million in the previous year. This was mainly driven by growth in the Other revenue segment, which saw a 33.0% increase from $6,399 million to $8,387 million.

2.Net income:

Google's net income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 was $10,905 million, $1,015 million above the previous year's net income of $9,890 million. This resulted in a net income margin of 6.9%, compared to an industry average of 2.8%. The increase in net income was primarily due to the growth in Other revenue, which greatly offset the increase in Operating expenses.

3.Gross margin:

Google's gross margin for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 was 65.7%, a slight decline from 66.7% in the previous year. This change was mainly due to the increase in Operating expenses, which rose from a percentage of sales of 34.9% in the previous year to 35.9% in the current year. The decrease in gross margin was partially compensated by increasing the Other revenue segment from 43.5% to 45.5% of sales.

Operational Efficiency:
1.Operating margin:

Google's operating margin for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 was 21.5%, lower than the industry average of 23.3%. The decline in the operating margin was mainly due to the increase in net selling, general, and administrative expenses, which rose from a percentage of sales of 15.4% in the previous year to 16.2% in the current year. This increase was partially offset by the growth in Other revenue, which rose from a percentage of sales of 43.5% in the previous year to 45.5% in the current year.

2.Cost management effectiveness:

Google's cost management effectiveness can be assessed by analyzing the relationship between net selling, general, and administrative expenses and net income. The company's G&A expenses as a percentage of net income increased from 33.0% in the previous year to 35.9% in the current year. This indicates that the increase in these expenses was not as efficiently managed as an increase in net income. However, the increase in Other revenue helped to mitigate this inefficiency.

Liquidity and Solvency:
1.Current ratio:

Google's current ratio was 1.6, indicating that the company had a 6-month liquidity position, which is in line with industry standards. The increase in current assets, $135,155 million, was driven mainly by the increase in inventory, $5,637 million.

2.Quick ratio:

Google's quick ratio was 1.1, indicating that the company had a 4-month liquidity position, which is below industry standards. The increase in inventory, $5,637 million, was a significant contributor to this decrease in liabilities, which are financial instruments that will or may be converted into cash quickly.

3.Debt-to-equity ratio:

Google's debt-to-equity ratio was 0.6, indicating that the company's debt totaled 60% of its equity, which is higher than industry standards. This reflects the company's heavy reliance on debt financing, which increased from $89,210 million in
