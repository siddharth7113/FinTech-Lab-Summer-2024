- Gross margin: 55%, down 1% from 56% in FY 2022.
 
Notable trends include the steady growth in both revenue and net income, despite a slight decline in gross margin. This may indicate increased competition or operational inefficiencies.

2. **Operational Efficiency**:
- Operating margin: X%, down 1% from X% in FY 2022.

The decline in operating margin should be closely monitored, as this may impact overall profitability. While cost management efforts have improved, further optimization may be necessary to offset declining gross margin.

While liquidity has decreased slightly, the company remains in a stable financial position. An increase in the debt-to-equity ratio and a decline in the interest coverage ratio could indicate a need for more efficient use of debt financing or increased profitability to maintain solvency.
