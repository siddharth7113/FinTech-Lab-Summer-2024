This was driven by the increase in Net Income for the period, as well as improved gross margins. However, this was offset by an increase in capital expenditures and a decline in Investing cash outflow related to property, plant and equipment.

In terms of future growth prospects, Microsoft has continued to shift its focus towards cloud-based subscription revenue. The company has also been investing heavily in its AI and cloud technologies, which are expected to drive future growth. Additionally, Microsoft has been expanding its presence in emerging markets, such as the Middle East and Africa.
